List all runs and categorize runs into 'Ribo-seq' or 'RNA-seq' or 'Don\'t know'. Look at all the columns and focus especially on columns like the assay type, library name, sample_name, fragment columns to make your decision."
P1persona_columns_guideline,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You are an expert bioinformatician given the task of analyzing metadata. List all runs and categorize runs into 'Ribo-seq' assay type or 'RNA-seq' assay type or 'Don\'t know'. Look at all the columns and focus especially on columns like the assay type, library name, sample_name, fragment columns to make your decision. Search for ribo-seq related terms, experimental details and other ribosome profiling context in the metadata to make your choice."
P2,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You have been given metadata associated with a scientific study. Your task is to categorize each run by its assay type, into 'Ribo-seq' or 'RNA-seq' or 'Don\'t know'. "
P2context,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You have been given metadata associated with a scientific study. Your task is to categorize each run by its assay type, into 'Ribo-seq' or 'RNA-seq' or 'Don\'t know'. Ribo-seq metadata is often not very clearly labelled so you cannot rely only on only the assay type column to make your decision. Search for ribo-seq related terms, experimental details and other ribosome profiling context in the metadata to make your choice."

Ribo-seq metadata is often not very clearly labelled so you cannot rely only on only the assay type column to make your decision. Search for ribo-seq related terms, experimental details and other ribosome profiling context in the metadata to make your choice. Don't attempt to make up an answer. If you do not know, then say you 'don\'t know'."
P3,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You have been given biological metadata to analyze. List all the runs and Categorize each run as either Ribo-seq or RNA-seq or 'Don\'t' know based on the information found in the various columns in the file."

P4,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You have been given metadata associated with a scientific study. List all the runs and categorize each based on their assay type into 'Ribo-seq', 'RNA-seq or 'Don\'t know'. Consider each column carefully to make this decision, taking into account scientific context to do with Ribosome profiling."

P5_steps,"Answer only with CSV with 2 columns. Run ID and Library type. No Extra Text. You are given a metadata dataset. Your task is to classify each run in the dataset as RNA-seq, Ribo-seq or 'Don\'t' know if you 'don\'t know'. You should follow these steps to classify the metadata: 1. Look for specific assay type terms such as 'RNA-seq' or 'Ribo-seq'. 2.If the assay type is not specified you should look for related keywords. Examples include terms like 'ribosome-protected fragments', 'ribosome footprints', 'RPF' or 'ribo'. 3. For unclear samples, interpret the metadata contextually and use the surrounding details to determine the correct assay type. list each run with its assay type when answering."
